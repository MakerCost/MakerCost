```
src/components/quote/
â”œâ”€â”€ QuoteActions.tsx          # Main quote buttons
â”œâ”€â”€ QuoteFinalizationModal.tsx # Full quote preview and editing
â””â”€â”€ ShippingModal.tsx         # Shipping details popup
```

### Data Flow

2. Clicks "Add to Quote" â†’ Product added to quote store
3. Form resets (except project/client info)
4. User can add more products or finalize

- VAT settings (reset to defaults)

**Preserved fields:**
