                Why Simple Hide Cost Calculations Destroy Leather Business Profits
              </h2>

              <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
                The biggest mistake in <strong>leather crafting business</strong> pricing is calculating only raw hide 
                costs while ignoring the complex economics of leather working. Professional operations understand that

                Unlike simple craft projects, leather working involves precision cutting, specialized construction 
                techniques, and finishing processes that require significant skill and time investment. Successful 
                businesses develop comprehensive costing systems that capture these complexities while supporting 
                sustainable growth in competitive artisan markets.

                Understanding True Hide Costs and Quality Variables
              </h3>

              <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
                Effective <strong>leather hide costs</strong> analysis requires understanding that hide prices vary 
                dramatically with grade, tannage, and thickness specifications. Top-grain vegetable-tanned hides might 
                cost $8-15 per square foot, while exotic leathers can cost $25-75 per square foot, requiring different 
                pricing strategies and market positioning for each material category.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
                Professional leather workers develop supplier relationships that ensure consistent quality and competitive 
                pricing while maintaining adequate inventory across popular leather types. Hide selection affects not 
                only material costs but also working characteristics, finishing requirements, and final product durability.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">
                Waste Factor Management and Cutting Optimization
