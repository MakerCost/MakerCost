                Why Simple Ink Cost Calculations Destroy Sublimation Business Profits
              </h2>

              <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
                The biggest mistake in <strong>sublimation printing business</strong> pricing is calculating only ink 
                and substrate costs while ignoring the complex economics of sublimation production. Professional operations 
                understand that true costs include heat press depreciation, transfer paper waste, color management overhead, 
                quality control time, and substrate preparation that can easily double apparent material expenses.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
                Unlike simple printing processes, sublimation involves precise temperature and time control, specialized 
                substrates, and color-critical workflows that create significant operational complexities. Successful

                True Ink Consumption Tracking and Optimization
              </h3>

              <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
                Effective <strong>sublimation ink costs</strong> analysis requires understanding that actual consumption 
                exceeds theoretical coverage by 25-40% due to head cleaning, color matching, and print quality optimization. 
                Different image types create varying ink densities that affect coverage rates beyond simple square inch 
                calculations, requiring sophisticated usage tracking for accurate costing.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
                Professional operations monitor ink consumption by image category and substrate type to establish accurate 
                usage rates that account for cleaning cycles, test prints, and optimization runs. This data enables precise
